<p>1 Welcome to Sonic Pi</p>

<h1>Welcome friend :-)</h1>

<p>Welcome to Sonic Pi. Hopefully you're as excited to get started making
crazy sounds as I am to show you. It's going to be a really <em>fun</em> ride
where you'll learn all about music, synthesis, programming, composition,
performance and more.</p>

<p>But wait, how rude of me! Let me introduce myself - I'm
<a href="http://twitter.com/samaaron">Sam Aaron</a> - the chap that created Sonic
Pi. You can find me at <a href="http://twitter.com/samaaron">@samaaron</a> on
Twitter and I'd be more than happy to say hello to you.  You might also
be interested in finding out more about my
<a href="http://facebook.com/livecodersamaaron">Live Coding Performances</a> where
I code with Sonic Pi live in front of audiences.</p>

<p>If you have any thoughts, or ideas for improving Sonic Pi - please pass
them on - feedback is so helpful. You never know, your idea might be the
next big feature!</p>

<p>This tutorial is divided up into sections grouped by category. Whilst
I've written it to have an easy learning progression from start to
finish, feel very free just to dip in and out of sections as you see
fit. If you feel that there's something missing, do let me know and I'll
consider it for a future version.</p>

<p>Finally, watching others live code is a really great way to learn. I
regularly stream live on
<a href="http://youtube.com/samaaron">http://youtube.com/samaaron</a> so please do
drop by, say hi and ask me lots of questions :-)</p>

<p>OK, let's get started...</p>

<p>2 Synths</p>

<h1>Synths</h1>

<p>OK, enough of the intros - let's get into some sound.</p>

<p>In this section we'll cover the basics of triggering and manipulating
synths. Synth is short for synthesiser which is a fancy word for
something which creates sounds. Typically synths are quite complicated
to use - especially analog synths such as Eurorack modules connected
together by a mess of wires. However, Sonic Pi gives you much of that
power in a very simple and approachable manner.</p>

<p>Don't be fooled by the immediate simplicity of Sonic Pi's interface. You
can get very deep into very sophisticated sound manipulation if that's
your thing. Hold on to your hats...</p>
