  <h1>1 Welcome to Sonic Pi</h1>
  <div class="content hidden">
<h2>Welcome friend :-)</h2>

<p>Welcome to Sonic Pi. Hopefully you're as excited to get started making
crazy sounds as I am to show you. It's going to be a really <em>fun</em> ride
where you'll learn all about music, synthesis, programming, composition,
performance and more.</p>

<p>But wait, how rude of me! Let me introduce myself - I'm
<a href="http://twitter.com/samaaron">Sam Aaron</a> - the chap that created Sonic
Pi. You can find me at <a href="http://twitter.com/samaaron">@samaaron</a> on
Twitter and I'd be more than happy to say hello to you.  You might also
be interested in finding out more about my
<a href="http://facebook.com/livecodersamaaron">Live Coding Performances</a> where
I code with Sonic Pi live in front of audiences.</p>

<p>If you have any thoughts, or ideas for improving Sonic Pi - please pass
them on - feedback is so helpful. You never know, your idea might be the
next big feature!</p>

<p>This tutorial is divided up into sections grouped by category. Whilst
I've written it to have an easy learning progression from start to
finish, feel very free just to dip in and out of sections as you see
fit. If you feel that there's something missing, do let me know and I'll
consider it for a future version.</p>

<p>Finally, watching others live code is a really great way to learn. I
regularly stream live on
<a href="http://youtube.com/samaaron">http://youtube.com/samaaron</a> so please do
drop by, say hi and ask me lots of questions :-)</p>

<p>OK, let's get started...</p>

  <h1>1.1 Live Coding</h1>
  <div class="content hidden">
<h2>Live Coding</h2>

<p>One of the most exciting aspects of Sonic Pi is that it enables you to
write and <em>modify code live</em> to make music, just like you might perform
live with a guitar. This means that given some practice you can take
Sonic Pi on stage and gig with it.</p>

<h3>Free your mind</h3>

<p>Before we get into the real details of how Sonic Pi works in the rest of
this tutorial, I'd like to give you an experience of what it's like to
live code. Don't worry if you don't understand much (or any) of
this. Just try to hold onto your seats and enjoy...</p>

<h3>A live loop</h3>

<p>Let's get started, copy the following code into an empty buffer above:</p>

<span><code><pre>
live_loop :flibble do
  sample :bd_haus, rate: 1
  sleep 0.5
end
</pre></code></span>

<p>Now, press the <code>Run</code> button and you'll hear a nice fast bass drum
beating away. If at any time you wish to stop the sound just hit the
<code>Stop</code> button. Although don't hit it just yet... Instead, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure the bass drum sound is still running</li>
<li>Change the <code>sleep</code> value from <code>0.5</code> to something higher like <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>Press the <code>Run</code> button again</li>
<li>Notice how the drum speed has changed.</li>
<li>Finally, <em>remember this moment</em>, this is the first time you've live
coded with Sonic Pi and it's unlikely to be your last...</li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, that was simple enough. Let's add something else into the mix. Above
<code>sample :bd_haus</code> add the line <code>sample :ambi_choir, rate: 0.3</code>. Your
code should look like this:</p>

<span><code><pre>
live_loop :flibble do
  sample :ambi_choir, rate: 0.3
  sample :bd_haus, rate: 1
  sleep 1
end
</pre></code></span>

<p>Now, play around. Change the rates - what happens when you use high
values, or small values or negative values? See what happens when you
change the <code>rate:</code> value for the <code>:ambi_choir</code> sample just slightly (say
to <code>0.29</code>). What happens if you choose a really small <code>sleep</code> value? See
if you can make it go so fast your computer will stop with an error
because it can't keep up (if that happens, just choose a bigger <code>sleep</code>
time and hit <code>Run</code> again).</p>

<p>Try commenting one of the <code>sample</code> lines out by adding a <code>#</code> to the
beginning:</p>

<span><code><pre>
live_loop :flibble do
  sample :ambi_choir, rate: 0.3
  sample :bd_haus, rate: 1
  sleep 1
  end
</pre></code></span>

<p>Notice how it tells the computer to ignore it, so we don't hear it. This
is called a comment. In Sonic Pi we can use comments to remove and add
things into the mix.</p>

<p>Finally, let me leave you something fun to play with. Take the code below,
and copy it into a spare buffer. Now, don't try to understand it too
much other than see that there are two loops - so two things going round
at the same time. Now, do what you do best - experiment and play
around. Here are some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try changing the blue <code>rate:</code> values to hear the sample sound change.</li>
<li>Try changing the <code>sleep</code> times and hear that both loops can spin round
at different rates.</li>
<li>Try uncommenting the sample line (remove the <code>#</code>) and enjoy the sound
of the guitar played backwards.</li>
<li>Try changing any of the blue <code>mix:</code> values to numbers between <code>0</code> (not
in the mix) and <code>1</code> (fully in the mix).</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to press <code>Run</code> and you'll hear the change next time the loop
goes round. If you end up in a pickle, don't worry - hit <code>Stop</code>, delete
the code in the buffer and paste a fresh copy in and you're ready to
jam again. Making mistakes is how you'll learn the quickest...</p>

<span><code><pre>
live_loop :guit do
  with_fx :echo, mix: 0.3, phase: 0.25 do
    sample :guit_em9, rate: 0.5
end

sample :guit_em9, rate: -0.5
sleep 8
end

live_loop :boom do
  with_fx :reverb, room: 1 do
    sample :bd_boom, amp: 10, rate: 1
  end
  sleep 8
end
</pre></code></span>

<p>Now, keep playing and experimenting until your curiosity about how this
all actually works kicks in and you start wondering what else you can do
with this. You're now ready to read the rest of the tutorial.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for...</p>

  <h1>1.2 Exploring the Interface</h1>

  <div class="content hidden">
<h2>The Sonic Pi Interface</h2>

<p>Sonic Pi has a very simple interface for coding music. Let's spend a
little time exploring it.</p>

<p><img src="assets/GUI.png" title="the Interface..." /></p>

<ul>
<li><em>A</em> - Play Controls</li>
<li><em>B</em> - Editor Controls</li>
<li><em>C</em> - Info and Help</li>
<li><em>D</em> - Code Editor</li>
<li><em>E</em> - Prefs Panel</li>
<li><em>F</em> - Log Viewer</li>
<li><em>G</em> - Help System</li>
<li><em>H</em> - Scope Viewer</li>
</ul>

<h3>A. Play Controls</h3>

<p>These pink buttons are the main controls for starting and stopping
sounds. There's the <em>Run</em> button for running the code in the editor,
<em>Stop</em> for stopping all running code, <em>Save</em> for saving the code to an
external file and <em>Record</em> to create a recording (a WAV file) of the
sound playing.</p>

<h3>B. Editor Controls</h3>

<p>These orange buttons allow you to manipulate the code editor. The <em>Size
+</em> and <em>Size -</em> buttons allow you to make the text bigger and
smaller.</p>

<h3>C. Info and Help</h3>

<p>These blue buttons give you access to information, help and
preferences. The <em>Info</em> button will open up the information window which
contains information about Sonic Pi itself - the core team, history,
contributors and community. The <em>Help</em> button toggles the help system
(<em>G</em>) and the <em>Prefs</em> button toggles the preferences window which allows
you to control some basic system parameters.</p>

<h3>D. Code Editor</h3>

<p>This is the area where you'll write your code and compose/perform
music. It's a simple text editor where you can write code, delete it,
cut and paste, etc. Think of it like a very basic version of Word or
Google Docs. The editor will automatically colour words based on their
meaning in the code. This may seem strange at first, but you'll soon
find it very useful. For example, you'll know something is a number
because it is blue.</p>

<h3>E. Prefs Panel</h3>

<p>Sonic Pi supports a number of tweakable preferences which can be
accessed by toggling the <em>prefs</em> button in the Info and Help button
set. This will toggle the visibility of the Prefs Panel which includes a
number of options to be changed. Examples are forcing mono mode,
inverting stereo, toggling log output verbosity and also a volume slider
and audio selector on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h3>F. Log Viewer</h3>

<p>When you run your code, information about what the program is doing will
be displayed in the log viewer. By default, you'll see a message for
every sound you create with the exact time the sound was triggered. This
is very useful for debugging your code and understanding what your code
is doing.</p>

<h3>G. Help System</h3>

<p>One of the most important parts of the Sonic Pi interface is
the help system which appears at the bottom of the window. This can be
toggled on and off by clicking on the blue <em>Help</em> button. The help
system contains help and information about all aspects of Sonic Pi
including this tutorial, a list of available synths, samples, examples,
FX and a full list of all the functions Sonic Pi provides for coding
music.</p>

<h3>H. Scope Viewer</h3>

<p>The scope viewer allows you to see the sound you're hearing. You can
easily see that the saw wave looks like a saw and that the basic beep is
a curvey sine wave. You can also see the difference between loud and
quiet sounds by the size of the lines. There are 3 scopes to play with -
the default is a combined scope for the left and right channels, there
is a stereo scope which draws a separate scope for each channel. Finally
there is a Lissajous curve scope which will show the phase relationship
between the left and right channels and allows you to draw pretty
pictures with sound (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve).</p>

  <h1>1.3 Learning through Play</h1>
  <div class="content hidden">

<h2>Learning through Play</h2>

<p>Sonic Pi encourages you to learn about both computing and music through
play and experimentation. The most important thing is that you're having
fun, and before you know it you'll have accidentally learned how to
code, compose and perform.</p>

<h3>There are no mistakes</h3>

<p>Whilst we're on this subject, let me just give you one piece of advice
I've learned over my years of live coding with music - <em>there are no
mistakes, only opportunities</em>. This is something I've often heard in
relation to jazz but it works equally well with live coding. No matter
how experienced you are - from a complete beginner to a seasoned
live coder, you'll run some code that has a completely unexpected
outcome. It might sound insanely cool - in which case run with
it. However, it might sound totally jarring and out of place. It doesn't
matter that it happened - what matters is what you do next with it. Take
the sound, manipulate it and morph it into something awesome. The crowd
will go <em>wild</em>.</p>

<h3>Start Simple</h3>

<p>When you're learning, it's tempting to want to do amazing things
<em>now</em>. However, just hold that thought and see it as a distant goal to
reach <em>later</em>. For now, instead think of the <em>simplest</em> thing you could
write which would be fun and rewarding that's a small step towards the
amazing thing you have in your head. Once you have an idea about that
simple step, then try and build it, play with it and then see what new
ideas it gives you. Before long you'll be too busy having fun and making
real progress. </p>

<p>Just make sure to share your work with others!</p>

  <h1>2 Synths</h1>

  <div class="content hidden">

<h2>Synths</h2>

<p>OK, enough of the intros - let's get into some sound.</p>

<p>In this section we'll cover the basics of triggering and manipulating
synths. Synth is short for synthesiser which is a fancy word for
something which creates sounds. Typically synths are quite complicated
to use - especially analog synths such as Eurorack modules connected
together by a mess of wires. However, Sonic Pi gives you much of that
power in a very simple and approachable manner.</p>

<p>Don't be fooled by the immediate simplicity of Sonic Pi's interface. You
can get very deep into very sophisticated sound manipulation if that's
your thing. Hold on to your hats...</p>
